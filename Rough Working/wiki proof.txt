==Proof==
Zeckendorf's theorem has two parts:

#'''Existence''': every positive integer {{mvar|n}} has a Zeckendorf representation.
#'''Uniqueness''': no positive integer {{mvar|n}} has two different Zeckendorf representations.

The first part of Zeckendorf's theorem (existence) can be proven by [[Mathematical induction|induction]]. For {{math|1=''n'' = 1, 2, 3}} it is clearly true (as these are Fibonacci numbers), for {{math|1=''n'' = 4}} we have {{math|1=4 = 3 + 1}}. If {{math|''n''}} is a Fibonacci number then there is nothing to prove. Otherwise there exists {{mvar|j}} such that {{math|''F''<sub>''j''</sub> < ''n'' < ''F''<sub>''j'' + 1</sub> }}. Now suppose each positive integer {{math|''a'' < ''n''}} has a Zeckendorf representation (induction hypothesis) and consider {{math|1=''b'' = ''n'' − ''F''<sub>''j''</sub> }}. Since {{math|''b'' < ''n''}}, {{mvar|b}} has a Zeckendorf representation by the induction hypothesis. At the same time, {{math|1=''b'' = ''n'' − ''F''<sub>''j''</sub> < ''F''<sub>''j'' + 1</sub> − ''F''<sub>''j''</sub> {{=}} ''F''<sub>''j'' − 1</sub> }} (we apply the definition of Fibonacci number in the last equality), so the Zeckendorf representation of {{mvar|b}} does not contain {{math|''F''<sub>''j'' − 1</sub> }}, and hence also does not contain {{math|''F''<sub>''j''</sub> }}. As a result, {{math|''n''}} can be represented as the sum of {{mvar|F<sub>j</sub>}} and the Zeckendorf representation of {{mvar|b}}, such that the Fibonacci numbers involved in the sum are distinct.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |last=Henderson |first=Nik |date=July 23, 2016 |title=What Is Zeckendorf's Theorem? |url=https://math.osu.edu/sites/math.osu.edu/files/henderson_zeckendorf.pdf |access-date=August 23, 2024 |website=Ohio State University}}</ref>

The second part of Zeckendorf's theorem (uniqueness) requires the following lemma:

:''Lemma'': The sum of any non-empty set of distinct, non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers whose largest member is {{mvar|F<sub>j</sub>}} is strictly less than the next larger Fibonacci number {{math|''F''<sub>''j'' + 1</sub> }}.

The lemma can be proven by induction on {{mvar|j}}.

Now take two non-empty sets <math>S</math> and <math>T</math> of distinct non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers which have the same sum, <math display="inline">\sum_{x \in S} x = \sum_{x \in T} x</math>. Consider sets <math>S'</math> and <math>T'</math> which are equal to <math>S</math> and <math>T</math> from which the common elements have been removed (i.&nbsp;e. <math>S' = S\setminus T</math> and <math>T' = T\setminus S</math>).  Since <math>S</math> and <math>T</math> had equal sum, and we have removed exactly the elements from <math>S\cap T</math> from both sets, <math>S'</math> and <math>T'</math> must have the same sum as well, <math display="inline">\sum_{x \in S'} x = \sum_{x \in T'} x</math>.

Now we will show [[Proof by contradiction|by contradiction]] that at least one of <math>S'</math> and <math>T'</math> is empty. Assume the contrary, i.&nbsp;e. that <math>S'</math> and <math>T'</math> are both non-empty and let the largest member of <math>S'</math> be {{mvar|F<sub>s</sub>}} and the largest member of <math>T'</math> be {{mvar|F<sub>t</sub>}}. Because <math>S'</math> and <math>T'</math> contain no common elements, {{math|''F''<sub>''s''</sub> ≠ ''F''<sub>''t''</sub>}}. [[Without loss of generality]], suppose {{math|''F''<sub>''s''</sub> < ''F''<sub>''t''</sub>}}. Then by the lemma, <math display="inline">\sum_{x \in S'} x < F_{s + 1}</math>, and, by the fact that <math display="inline">F_{s} < F_{s + 1} \leq F_{t}</math>,  <math display="inline">\sum_{x \in S'} x < F_t</math>, whereas clearly <math display="inline">\sum_{x \in T'} x \geq F_t</math>. This contradicts the fact that <math>S'</math> and <math>T'</math> have the same sum, and we can conclude that either <math>S'</math> or <math>T'</math> must be empty.

Now assume (again without loss of generality) that <math>S'</math> is empty. Then <math>S'</math> has sum 0, and so must <math>T'</math>. But since <math>T'</math> can only contain positive integers, it must be empty too. To conclude: <math>S' = T' = \emptyset</math> which implies <math>S = T</math>, proving that each Zeckendorf representation is unique.<ref name=":0" />
