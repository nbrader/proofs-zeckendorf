(*
  It should be very easy to prove the zeckendorf theorem using zeck which is implemented with zeck_lists.

  1.
  The zeckendorf representation only includes fibonacci numbers because zeck_lists only adds fibonacci numbers.

  2.
  The zeckendorf representation only includes non-consecutive fibonacci numbers because:
  - The largest fibonacci number is only consed on to lists that themselves are non-consecutive and
  - The fibonacci number consed is the fibonacci number after the next fibonacci number after the largest fibonacci number in the list being consed onto.
       - This can be seen in the line: let part2 := map (fun xs => fib (n2 + 3) :: xs) (zeck_lists n2) in
  
  3.
  Every integer has a zeckendorf representation because every iteration simply re-adds the representations from two iterations ago plus exactly the least number required to not repeat an existing total.
