(*
  It should be very easy to prove the zeckendorf theorem using zeck which is implemented with zeck_lists.

  1.
  The zeckendorf representation only includes fibonacci numbers because zeck_lists only adds fibonacci numbers.

  2.
  The zeckendorf representation only includes non-consecutive fibonacci numbers because:
  - The largest fibonacci number is only consed on to lists that themselves are non-consecutive and
  - The fibonacci number consed is the fibonacci number after the next fibonacci number after the largest fibonacci number in the list being consed onto.
       - This can be seen in the line: let part2 := map (fun xs => fib (n2 + 3) :: xs) (zeck_lists n2) in
  
  3.
  Every integer has a zeckendorf representation because every iteration simply re-adds the representations from two iterations ago plus exactly the least number required to not repeat an existing total.

(* =============================================================================
   PROOF OF ZECKENDORF'S THEOREM USING zeck_lists
   =============================================================================

   The key insight of this proof is that zeck_lists constructs all valid
   Zeckendorf representations by a recursive combinatorial construction:

   - zeck_lists(n) includes all representations from zeck_lists(n-1)
   - Plus: fib(n+2) consed onto each representation from zeck_lists(n-2)

   This ensures non-consecutiveness because we skip exactly one Fibonacci number.
