  Key Lemma for Uniqueness: Sum bound for non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers

  The sum of any non-empty list of distinct, non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers
  whose largest member is F_k (with k >= 2) is strictly less than F_{k+1}.

  Note: We require k >= 2 to avoid the ambiguity that fib(1) = fib(2) = 1.
  In proper Zeckendorf representations, we only use Fibonacci numbers from
  indices >= 2, i.e., the sequence 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...

  Proof strategy:
  - Use induction on k
  - Base case: k = 2 can be verified directly
  - Inductive case: Consider a list with maximum F_k
    * Since no consecutive Fibs, fib(k-1) is NOT in the list
    * Removing fib(k) from list gives a list with max ≤ fib(k-2)
    * By IH, sum(rest) < fib(k-1)
    * So total sum = fib(k) + sum(rest) < fib(k) + fib(k-1) = fib(k+1)

  This lemma is crucial for proving uniqueness.

  Theorem: Uniqueness of Zeckendorf representation (ADMITTED)

  Every positive integer has a unique representation as a sum of
  non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers.

  This is Zeckendorf's theorem proper. It states that if two lists both
  satisfy the Zeckendorf representation properties for the same number n,
  then they must be equal (up to reordering).

  Proof strategy (following the wiki proof):
  1. Assume l1 and l2 are both valid Zeckendorf representations of n
  2. Remove common elements from both to get l1' and l2'
  3. l1' and l2' still have the same sum (since we removed equal elements)
  4. Assume by contradiction that both l1' and l2' are non-empty
  5. Let F_s be the max of l1' and F_t be the max of l2'
  6. Since l1' and l2' share no elements, F_s ≠ F_t
  7. WLOG assume F_s < F_t
  8. By the lemma, sum(l1') < F_{s+1} ≤ F_t ≤ sum(l2')
  9. This contradicts sum(l1') = sum(l2')
  10. Therefore either l1' or l2' is empty
  11. If l1' is empty, it has sum 0, so l2' has sum 0, so l2' is empty
  12. Thus l1' = l2' = [], which means l1 = l2

  Note: This proof requires additional infrastructure for set operations,
  which is why it remains admitted. A complete formalization would need:
  - List filtering and difference operations
  - Properties of these operations preserving the invariants
  - The sum_nonconsec_fibs_bounded lemma
